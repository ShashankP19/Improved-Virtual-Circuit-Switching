# A Improved Virtual Circuit Switching Technology Based on Concurrent Processing Mode

### Overview

The key factor which restricts the development of modern high-speed networks is not the transmission rate of communication circuitry, but the exchange capacity of multi-port router/switch. The paper presents a new method of improved concurrent processing strategy, called Half Step Forward Switching Technology (HSFST) to improve the quality of switches for network service. 

In HSFST, information about next output ports are encapsulated in frames at the former switches, thus allowing the received data frame to directly switch to proper output ports without looking up for the information in switch table. So the operation of looking up for the information about next hop and the other operation can be processed simultaneously.
